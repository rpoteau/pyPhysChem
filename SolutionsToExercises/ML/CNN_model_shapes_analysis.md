**🔎 What your CNN does well**

- **Simple and clean**: 2 convolutional blocks → flatten → dense → output. Good for students learning CNNs.  
- **Dropout layers**: you’re already teaching regularization.  
- **Padding="same"**: keeps feature map sizes stable, avoids rapid shrinking.  
- **Adam optimizer**: robust default choice for toy examples.  

For a **didactic example on geometric shapes (circle/square/triangle)**, this is absolutely fine: students can see the pipeline, train quickly, and get a good accuracy.

**⚠️ Limitations (why SHAP looks weird / vertical bars)**

- **Only 16 filters per conv layer**  
  → the model may only learn a small set of “features”, often oriented edge detectors.

- **Shallow depth (2 conv layers)**  
  → feature maps stay very low-level (edges, gradients), never reaching abstract representations (shapes).

- **Flattening after convolution**  
  → discards spatial structure; fully connected layer has to “re-learn” it. A more modern design uses `GlobalAveragePooling2D()` instead.

- **Small dense layer (32 units)**  
  → fine for this dataset, but limits capacity.

**✅ Possible improvements (without making it too complex for teaching)**

- **Increase number of filters**  
  Instead of 16/16, use 32/64 (so it learns richer feature maps).  

- **Add a 3rd convolution block**  
  Deeper networks capture more abstract features.  

- **Replace Flatten with Global Average Pooling**  
  Keeps the connection to spatial features, makes the model more interpretable.  

- **Dense head**  
  Increase to 64 or 128 units before softmax → more expressive power.
