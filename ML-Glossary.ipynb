    "\n",
    "#### Attention\n",
    "\n",
    "A mechanism in neural networks that allows the model to focus on the\n",
    "most relevant parts of the input when making predictions. Instead of\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Bias (model bias)\n",
    "\n",
    "A form of systematic error in predictions that arises from overly\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Categorical data\n",
    "\n",

    "A supervised learning task predicting discrete categories or classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Clipping\n",
    "\n",
    "A technique used to limit the range of values during training. In neural\n",
    "networks, the most common form is **gradient clipping**, which sets\n",
    "a maximum threshold for gradient values to prevent exploding gradients\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "An unsupervised learning technique that groups data points into clusters\n",
    "based on similarity. Unlike classification, the groups (clusters) are\n",
    "not predefined but discovered by the algorithm. Common methods include\n",
    "k-means, hierarchical clustering, and DBSCAN. In chemistry, clustering\n",
    "can reveal families of molecules, materials, or spectra with similar\n",
    "properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Confidence / Uncertainty estimation\n",
    "\n",

    "**confidence score** expresses how certain the model is about a\n",
    "specific prediction, while **uncertainty estimation** goes further\n",
    "by assessing the variability or lack of knowledge in the prediction. In\n",
    "chemistry and materials science, uncertainty estimation helps identify\n",

    "drug design.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Convolution\n",
    "\n",
    "A mathematical operation that combines two functions to produce a third\n",

    "\n",
    "A model evaluation technique used to assess how well a machine learning\n",
    "model generalizes to unseen data. The dataset is split into several\n",
    "folds (subsets). The model is trained on some folds and tested on the\n",
    "remaining one, and the process is repeated until every fold has served\n",
    "as a test set. The results are then averaged. Common forms include\n",
    "**k-fold cross-validation** and **leave-one-out\n",
    "cross-validation**. In chemistry, it is often used to validate models\n",
    "built on limited datasets of molecules or materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Decision boundary\n",
    "\n",
    "In classification, the hypersurface in feature space that separates data\n",
    "points assigned to different classes. For simple models (e.g., logistic\n",
    "regression), the decision boundary may be a straight line or plane; for\n",
    "complex models (e.g., neural networks, ensemble methods), it can be\n",
    "highly non-linear. Visualizing decision boundaries helps illustrate how\n",
    "a model discriminates between classes.\n",

    "#### Decoder\n",
    "\n",
    "The counterpart of an encoder, designed to reconstruct or generate data\n",

    "as ML inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Dropout\n",
    "\n",
    "A regularization technique used in neural networks to prevent\n",

    "all neurons are used, with weights scaled accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Early Stopping\n",
    "\n",
    "A regularization technique in training neural networks where\n",
    "training is halted once performance on a validation set stops improving.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Encoder\n",
    "\n",
    "A component of a machine learning model that transforms input data\n",

    "images into a lower-dimensional vector that captures the most relevant\n",

    "\n",
    "A measure of uncertainty or disorder. In machine learning, entropy\n",
    "is used in information theory to quantify the unpredictability of a\n",
    "probability distribution, and it forms the basis of loss functions such\n",
    "as cross-entropy. In decision trees, entropy helps decide how to split\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Epoch\n",
    "\n",
    "One complete pass of the entire training dataset through the model\n",
    "during training. Training usually involves many epochs, each consisting\n",
    "of multiple **batches** (mini-batches). After each epoch, model\n",
    "parameters are updated based on all the data, and performance is\n",
    "typically evaluated on a validation set.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exploding gradients\n",
    "\n",
    "A problem in training deep neural networks where gradients grow\n",
    "excessively large during backpropagation, causing unstable weight\n",
    "updates and divergence of the model. Often occurs in very deep or\n",
    "recurrent networks. Gradient clipping is a common remedy.\n"

    "#### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the square root of the Mean Squared Error (MSE), and thus has the\n",

    "Typically:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- The **training set** is used to fit the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "\\- The **test set**, or **holdout set** is kept aside to evaluate\n",
    "generalization.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### Shuffle\n",
    "\n",
    "Randomly reordering the training data before each epoch. Shuffling\n",

    "producing highly detailed feature maps.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Larger strides (e.g., 2) reduce the size of the output by skipping\n",
    "positions, effectively downsampling the input.\n",
    "Stride works together with padding to control the spatial dimensions\n",

    "#### Supervised learning\n",
    "\n",
    "A type of machine learning where the model is trained on labeled data, i.e. input--output pairs are known. The goal is to learn the mapping from inputs (features) to outputs (targets). Example: predicting\n",
