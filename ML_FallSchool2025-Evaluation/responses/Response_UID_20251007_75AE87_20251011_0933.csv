2,2,4,"If you don't understand the code, when it change depending on your data or application, you can be very lost. IA is a good tool for coding, but learn the basic Python is a must.",3,4,"I learned how to do supervised AI by using python coding, train it to recognize patterns in different data (pictures, matrices, dataframe) and class it afterward.","It's a machine-trained neural network, that you can apply for your data treatment.","I think all of it, I don't have a preference. We worked on different workflow and thematic and we use it for other workflow","In my case, i'm interested in the un-supervized analysis. And of course, we did'nt have time to explore all the content so I'll use the Jupyter environment in the future !",2,"The learning pace was different depending on the teacher, and also on the python skills of the student. I used python before and even I thought it was a little too fast. But I wanted to understand the code so maybe that's why  ",3,4,3,5,4,4,I had time to just focus on the iris files before attending class,5,5,4,5,"For me, it's more challenging in the data treatment. Python librairies have lot of black boxes so it can also shape how you interpret data and make decision for future experiment (which can be absolutly wrong).",5,3,4,4,5,3,5,I plan to reuse it for my data treatment :),"It was amasing, and it went so fast ! Thank you for everything ^^
About a suggestion: explain more how the neural network works (hidden layer is still a mystery for me)",UID_20251007_75AE87
