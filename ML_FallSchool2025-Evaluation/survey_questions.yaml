      D1: "The mentored project helped me synthesize and apply the weekâ€™s concepts. (1 = not at all; 5 = very much)"
      D2: "The mentoring sessions helped me progress in understanding and applying the concepts introduced during the week. (1 = not at all; 5 = very much)"
      D3: "The environment encouraged open discussions and exchange of ideas with other participants. (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree)"

    questions:
      E1: "A generative AI helped me understand my coding errors better. (1 = not at all; 5 = very much)"
      E2: "I would recommend this training to peers. (1 = not at all; 5 = absolutely)"
      E3: "I perceive the integration of an AI assistant into practical courses positively. (1 = very negative; 5 = very positive)"
      E4: "I feel more aware of the ethical implications of AI in scientific research. (1 = not at all; 5 = very much)"
      E5: "In my view, what is the main ethical challenge of using AI in chemistry?"

  F:
    title: "Block F. Practical Transfer and Long-Term Usability"
    subtitle: "(assesses whether participants feel capable of re-using the tools and environments)"
    questions:
      F1: "I intend to use generative AI tools more thoughtfully in my future research. (1 = not at all; 5 = definitely)"
      F2: "I feel capable of running and adapting the provided notebooks independently after the school. (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree)"
      F3: "The instructions for installing Python and required libraries were clear and easy to follow. (1 = not at all; 5 = completely)"
