    "\n",
    "**JupyterLab** is a powerful, flexible interface for creating and sharing documents that combine live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text.  Here’s a quick guide to help you get started:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Opening JupyterLab**\n",
    "- Launch JupyterLab by running `jupyter-lab` in your command line or terminal. This will open the JupyterLab interface in your browser.\n",
    "- The interface includes a file browser on the left (&#128193; icon), where you can navigate to open an existing notebook (.ipynb file) or create a new one.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Working in JupyterLab**\n",
    "- Each notebook consists of cells, and there are mainly two types:\n",
    "  - **Code cells** for writing and executing code (e.g., Python).\n",
    "  - **Markdown cells** for formatted text, headers, lists, figures and equations. It is closely related to the HTML language\n",
    "- To switch cell types, click on a cell, and choose the type from the toolbar or right-click menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Running Code**\n",
    "- To run a code cell, click anywhere inside it and press `Shift + Enter`. The output (if any) will appear just below the cell.\n",
    "- Alternatively, use the “Run” button in the toolbar.\n",
    "    <img src=\"MiscImages/ToolbarJupyterNotebook.svg\" style=\"margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto; display: block; width:300px\" id=\"img_TBJN\" alt=\"Jupyter notebook toolbar\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Saving and Organizing Your Work**\n",
    "- JupyterLab autosaves frequently, but you can manually save by pressing `Ctrl + S` or clicking the save icon.\n",
    "- JupyterLab allows you to organize multiple notebooks, text files, and consoles in a tabbed workspace, making it easier to manage multiple files or analyses in one session.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5. Additional Tips**\n",
    "- Restarting the kernel clears all stored variables and data, helping to resolve unexpected results and recover from errors or crashes. You can applly this operation from the “Kernel” menu to reset your session.\n",
    "- JupyterLab supports a range of extensions to enhance functionality, from version control to additional plotting tools, which you can access through the extension manager.\n",
    "- If you click on a Mardown cell by accident, you will see the coding. The corresponding formatted text, images, tables or equations will be rendered by running the cell (`Shift + Enter` or play button)\n",
