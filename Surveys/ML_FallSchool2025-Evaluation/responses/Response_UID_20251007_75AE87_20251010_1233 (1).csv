- You train a model on some data, then see how it preforms on data it hasn't seen before.","Making models to analyse images - it was difficult, but we got a lot of time to learn and think about it.",Explainable AI,3,"I think there could be more details on the details of what the code is doing. I know we can just ask ChatGPT, but it would be more meaningful to understand the code more deeply, as ChatGPT cannot always solve our problems and we need to understand how to do it ourselves.",4,4,3,4,2,3,"Image processing of SAXS images and then training a CNN, then trying to use Shapeley values to explain the results.",1,4,1,3,"Avoiding bias in data
