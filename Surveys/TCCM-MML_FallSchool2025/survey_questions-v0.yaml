      D4: "What aspect of the learning pace or materials could be improved?"
      D5: "Given the amount of time (4h), the balance between lectures and the possibility to run data science and ML algorithms was appropriate. (1 = poor; 5 = excellent)"

      D7: "The explanations given during exercises were clear and adapted to my level. (1 = not at all; 5 = completely)"

  E:
    title: "Block E. Impact and Ethical Awareness"
    subtitle: "(measures attitudinal outcomes and perceived added value)"
    questions:
      E1: "A generative AI (chatGPT, Gemini, ...) could help me understand my coding errors better. (1 = not at all; 5 = very much)"
      E2: "I would recommend this training to peers. (1 = not at all; 5 = absolutely)"
      E3: "I perceive the integration of an AI assistant into practical courses positively. (1 = very negative; 5 = very positive)"
      E4: "I perceive explainable AI (xAI) tools as a way to perform grounded, data-driven scientific analysis and research. (1 = strongly disagree; 5 = strongly agree)"
      E5: "I feel more aware of the ethical implications of AI in scientific research. (1 = not at all; 5 = very much)"
